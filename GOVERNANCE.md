# Overview
This project is led by RSK and managed by the community. That is, the community actively contributes to the day-to-day maintenance of the project, but the general strategic line is drawn by RSK. In case of disagreement, they have the last word. It is RSK’s job to resolve disputes within the community and to ensure that the project is able to progress in a coordinated way. In turn, it is the community’s job to guide the decisions of RSK through active engagement and contribution.
